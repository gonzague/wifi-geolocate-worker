# üìç WiFi Geolocate Worker

![Geolocation Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Geolocate-WiFi%20Positioning-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=wifi&logoColor=white)

> Cloudflare Worker that proxies Apple's Wi-Fi positioning service. Provide one or more Wi-Fi access point BSSIDs (MAC addresses) and the worker returns the latitude/longitude Apple has on record. When you include signal strength readings, the worker also performs a weighted centroid to approximate the device position.

## ‚ú® Features
- üåê Accepts single or batched BSSID lookups over HTTP (GET or POST JSON)
- ‚úÖ Normalises and validates BSSIDs/signals before querying Apple
- üìä Summarises per-BSSID signal samples when provided
- üéØ Computes a weighted-centroid estimate when multiple signals are supplied
- üîÑ Falls back to Cloudflare's IP-based geolocation when Apple returns nothing
- üó∫Ô∏è Reverse geocoding - converts coordinates to human-readable addresses (optional)

## üìã Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** - Required to run Wrangler CLI. Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or use a version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- **Wrangler CLI** - Cloudflare's command-line tool for Workers development. See [installation guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- **Cloudflare account** - With Workers enabled (works with free plans at [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com))

## üõ†Ô∏è Wrangler Installation
Install Wrangler locally in your project (recommended) or globally:

**Local installation (recommended):**
```bash
npm install -D wrangler@latest
```

**Global installation:**
```bash
npm install -g wrangler@latest
```

**Check installation:**
```bash
npx wrangler --version
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
1. üì¶ Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. üîê Authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```
   This will open your browser to authenticate with Cloudflare. After authentication, you can close the browser tab and return to your terminal.

3. ‚öôÔ∏è Verify your Wrangler configuration:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler whoami
   ```
   This should display your Cloudflare account email if authentication was successful.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development
Run the worker locally with Wrangler's dev server:
```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

Requests sent to the printed local endpoint (default `http://127.0.0.1:8787`) will be formatted & forwarded to Apple's service and return the worker's JSON payload.

## üöÄ Deployment
Publish the worker to Cloudflare:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```
The deployment uses `wrangler.toml`, which points to `worker/index.js` and enables Smart Placement plus log streaming.

## üì° API Reference

### üåê GET `/`
Lookup a single access point by query string:
```
GET https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/?bssid=34:DB:FD:43:E3:A1&all=true&reverseGeocode=true
```
- `bssid` (required): 12 hexadecimal characters with or without separators.
- `all` (optional): Return every access point Apple responds with (`true`/`1`/`yes`). Defaults to `false`, which limits results to the requested BSSID(s).
- `reverseGeocode` (optional): Convert coordinates to human-readable addresses (`true`/`1`/`yes`). Defaults to `false`.

### üìÆ POST `/`
Submit JSON to query multiple access points and optionally include received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values in dBm.
```json
{
  "accessPoints": [
    { "bssid": "34:DB:FD:43:E3:A1", "signal": -52 },
    { "bssid": "34:DB:FD:43:E3:B2", "signal": -60 },
    { "bssid": "34:DB:FD:40:01:10", "signal": -70 }
  ],
  "all": false,
  "reverseGeocode": true
}
```
- `accessPoints` (required): Array of objects with `bssid` (string) and optional `signal` (number).
- `all` (optional): Same behaviour as the query parameter.
- `reverseGeocode` (optional): Convert coordinates to human-readable addresses (`true`/`1`/`yes`). Defaults to `false`.

### üìÑ Response Shape
A successful lookup returns JSON similar to:
```json
{
  "query": {
    "accessPoints": [
      { "bssid": "34:db:fd:43:e3:a1", "signal": -52 }
    ],
    "all": false
  },
  "found": true,
  "results": [
    {
      "bssid": "34:db:fd:43:e3:a1",
      "latitude": 48.856613,
      "longitude": 2.352222,
      "mapUrl": "https://www.google.com/maps/place/48.856613,2.352222",
      "signal": -52,
      "signalCount": 1,
      "signalMin": -52,
      "signalMax": -52,
      "address": {
        "displayName": "Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, √éle-de-France, France",
        "address": {
          "road": "Champs-√âlys√©es",
          "city": "Paris",
          "state": "√éle-de-France",
          "country": "France"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "triangulated": {
    "latitude": 48.8571,
    "longitude": 2.3519,
    "pointsUsed": 3,
    "weightSum": 6.84,
    "method": "weighted-centroid",
    "signalWeightModel": "10^(dBm/10)"
  }
}
```

When Apple returns no usable coordinates, `found` is `false` and the response includes `fallback` with Cloudflare's IP-based location metadata:
```json
{
  "query": {
    "accessPoints": [
      { "bssid": "12:34:56:78:90:ab", "signal": -65 }
    ],
    "all": false
  },
  "found": false,
  "fallback": {
    "latitude": 40.7128,
    "longitude": -74.0060,
    "accuracyRadius": 1000,
    "country": "US",
    "region": "NY",
    "city": "New York",
    "postalCode": "10001",
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "isp": "Cloudflare",
    "asOrganization": "Cloudflare, Inc."
  }
}
```

- Validation failures return HTTP 400 with an `error` message.
- Upstream problems with Apple result in HTTP 502 and an explanatory `error` payload.
- `address` field is only included in results when `reverseGeocode=true` is specified.

## üìù Data Notes
- BSSIDs are normalised to lowercase colon-separated hex (e.g., `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`).
- Signal values are interpreted as RSSI in dBm and clamped between -120 and -5 when computing weights.
- Reverse geocoding uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API (free, no API keys required, 1 request/second rate limit).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats
Apple's Wi-Fi positioning service is undocumented and may change without notice. Use this worker responsibly and respect local laws and Apple terms of service.

## üôè Credits
This project builds upon foundational research and implementations in Wi-Fi geolocation:

**Academic Research:**
- **[Fran√ßois-Xavier AGUESSY](https://fx.aguessy.fr/resources/pdf-articles/Rapport-PFE-interception-SSL-analyse-localisation-smatphones.pdf)** - Comprehensive academic study on SSL interception and smartphone geolocation data analysis
- **[C√¥me DEMOUSTIER](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c%C3%B4me-demoustier-54943a45/)** - Co-author of the groundbreaking research on Apple's geolocation protocols

**Open Source Implementation:**
- **[Darko Sancanin](https://github.com/darkosancanin)** - Creator of **[Apple BSSID Locator](https://github.com/darkosancanin/apple_bssid_locator)**, the original Python tool for Wi-Fi access point geolocation

This Cloudflare Worker version adapts these concepts for serverless HTTP API deployment while maintaining compatibility with Apple's Location Services API and protocol buffer structures documented in the original research. However we didn't implement the cell towers part.
